Ideas on potential projects:

CTA Adds Additional Bus Service Across City
Source: https://www.transitchicago.com/cta-adds-additional-bus-service-across-city/
* the additional bus service started August 25, 2024, "nearly a dozen bus routes are receiving additional service"

Claim (from Aug 23, 2024): "we've improved service on 59 bus routes this year - bringing our bus
system back to 98% of pre-pandemic scheduled service levels ... we are still on track to fully 
restore pre-pandemic schedules bus service by the end of 2024" -- IS THIS TRUE?

Which routes will get increased service?
21 Cermak
22 Clark
24 Wentworth
53A South Pulaski
62 Archer
77 Belmont
87 87th
94 California
146 Inner Lake Shore/Michigan express
152 Addison
156 LaSalle

"The CTA has seen increased in ridership on routes that have received additional service throughout the
year. Ridership on routes receiving additional service in March went up 21% year-over-year during June 
and July. Ridership on the routes that received additional service in June was up 18% year-over-year
during June and July. Routes that did not receive service adjustments this year have also seen 12%
higher ridership year-over-year during the same period."

CTA Launches New Frequent Network for Buses
source: https://www.transitchicago.com/cta-launches-new-frequent-network-for-buses/
Starting March 23, 2025, CTA implemented service that will arrive every 10 minutes or sooner on
20 bus routes between 6am-9pm on weekdays, 9am-9pm on weekends (most service improvement will be seen
midday, evenings, and weekends). 
"Routes that are part of the Frequent Network will see the highest level of scheduled service since 2010
when the CTA was forced to implement service reductions due to funding constraints. With the initial set of eight 
routes going live this Spring, 35% of the population will be within a half mile of a Frequent Route. Once the 
Frequent Network is fully implemented, by the end of 2025, 70% of the CTA service area will be within
half a mile of a frequent route."

The 8 routes that are part of the initial stage:
J14 Jeffery Jump
34 South Michigan
47 47th Street
54 Cicero
60 Blue Island/26th
63 63rd Treet
79 79th Street
95 95th Street

Estimated that these lines J14, 34, 47, 60, 95 will see a 25% or more increase in service.
SO, a simple question is: is this true, can we see an increase in ridership on these lines already?
At what times of day?

Maybe we could look into what lines *should* have more buses added?

Information on Bus Vision Project:
The Chicago Bus Vision Project "will help shape how CTA reimagines Chicago's bus netowrk what improvements
it should implement in the future. It began with the development of a Framing Report, an extensive analysis
of the existing CTA bus network."

Some questions:
Ridership Impact:
* did ridership increase on the routes where the buses were added?
* how does ridership per bus compare before and after the change?
* was the increase in ridership statistically significant?

Operational Efficiency:
* did the average wait time or delay decreae?
* did the percentage of on-time arrivals improve?
* was bus congestion or overcrowding alleviated?

Cost-effectiveness:
* do we have information to figure out if cost per additional rider change?
* did added service provide good value compared to historical expenditure-to-ridership ratios?

Equity & Accessibility:
* were the increases in service targeted at underserved or high-demand areas?
* did the increase help improve access for neighborhoods with fewer transit options?

Some data science techniques we can use:
* time series analysis: compare ridership trends before and after bus additions
* causal inference: compare affected routes to similar unaffected ones over the same period
* geospatial analysis: visualize changes in ridership and wait times across neighborhoods
* clustering: group routes or stops to identify where the biggest gains were realized
* cost-benefit analysis: compare operational costs to change in ridership or service quality

Data sources and how to use them:
* bus tracking APIs: calculate wait times, headways, on-time performance
* ridership data: cmopare daily/route-level changes over time
* employee & expenditure data: analyze cost per route or per additional bus
* contract data: understand which routes were prioritized and how vendor performance may play a role

Possible deliverables:
* an interactive dashboard showing key performancce metrics for each route (before vs. after)
* a geospatial heatmap of ridership changes by neighborhood or stop
* a report quantifying the 'return on investment' of adding buses using ridership gains and cost data
* a machine learning model to predict which other routes might benefit from additional service
