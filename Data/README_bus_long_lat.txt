LINE
  Included many purely (or mostly) vertical or horizontal Chicago bus lines.

HV
  H = Horizontal
  V = Vertical

STREETNUM
  Adapted from Chicago Street Number as taken from https://www.transitchicago.com/maps/system/ and https://www.transitchicago.com/maps/downtown/
  For Horizontal lines, north is positive and south is negative
  For vertical lines, west is negative and east is positive
  5 lines have numbers with question marks -- these should probably just be deleted since these lines are too "wiggly".

FREQUENTNETWORK
  If the line is part of the 2025 "frequent network" plan, the season it is included is entered. (See https://www.transitchicago.com/frequent/.) Not all are purely V/H
