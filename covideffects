I want to understand the main period of time that the CTA experienced reduced ridership and service due to COVID

https://news.wttw.com/2021/12/29/how-covid-19-has-impacted-cta-ridership
(primarily about train ridership).
* study from the Urban Institute found that while ridership in downtown decreased, neighborhoods with
more Black and Lantinx residents saw more sustained ridership.
  * the Pulaski Blue Line stop, Conservatory Green Line stop, Central Green Line stop (all on West side)
    saw smallest decline in ridership
  * Merchandise Mart Brown/Purple Line, Addison Red line, Monroe Blue line saw largest decrease in ridership

* systemwide increases in ridership in 2023: for bus, 15.5% increase over 2022; for trian, 13.4% increase
* CTA ridership dropped to 20% in April 2020, gradually risen to just over 60% of pre-pandemic ridership (as of Jan 2024)
